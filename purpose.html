              <h2>GLOBAL WARMING & POLLUTION</h2>
              <p>The definition of global warming is the overall temperature increase for the atmosphere of the earth due to greenhouse gasses. The temperature of the earth has been recorded at 1-1Â°C and is on the trend of rising. Global warming is happening mainly due to the harmful resources we use, and the greenhouse gasses which they release into the earth. This includes fossil fuels, cattle, and more. Along with the demolition and burning of forests, removing the only source which can remove Co2 from the air. Along with global warming, we have pollution. Plastic pollutes the seas and kills hundreds of animals who don't realise plastic is unedible, and destroys ecosystems through this. This pollution comes purely from our factories, the ones producing the products we consume everyday. Our earth is on a path to destruction, and it's our fault.</p>

              <h2>THE AFFECT OF COMPANIES ON EARTH</h2>
              <p>We live in capitalism, where trade and products are important for the circulation of everything. The problem arises when resources need to be harvested and products must be made, all for money. Factories will cut corners and use 'efficient' fuel sources which pollute the earth, and easy materials like plastic to create. These same plastics being the ones dumped into the ocean, or buried in landfill, bloating our earth with garbage we're leaving for future generations. Thats not even mentioning global warming, which is caused from using the harmful synthetic materials. There are more natural sources, but most companies refuse to use these as they're too 'expensive', and that they dont put cash into the big corporations wallets. </p>

              <h2>THE PATHWAY FORWARD</h2>
              <p>Here comes Verdure. We're commited to put a halt on the rapid consumption of terrible, evil corporations which pollute and kill our earth. There are so many companies out there who spread pure good with natural products that are incredibly great to the environment, or at least dont harm the environment. These brands are all small, as they fight the big fight with the limits that come from using eco-friendly materials. Here at Verdure, we're commited to giving the companies a platform in which they can be uplifted. We hope to promote mindful shopping, and becoming a eco-friendly consumer.</p>
