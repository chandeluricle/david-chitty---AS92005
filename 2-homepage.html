    <div class="page-text">
        <p>In our modern world, we suffer the looming threat of global warming and climate change. Whilst doing so,
            we consume so many products which affect our earth negatively. It's unavoidable to spend money on these products
            whether you mean to or not. Yet a few brands are working incredibly hard to be noticed, but stay in the background
            while the more wasteful, awful companies stay working hard. So Verdure's here to uplift all our small businesses
            who wish to reduce our carbon footprint, each product bought contributing to the health of our earth.</p>

        <p> Verdure's goal is to encourage eco-friendly shopping through uplifting our local eco-friendly brands and businesses.
            From fashion to beauty, we've selected a handful of brands who work their hardest to minimise their
            carbon footprint. In the battle against climate change, each of these small NZ businesses help you shop
            the green way, and we hope you find a product that'll help you with your eco-friendly journey.</p>
