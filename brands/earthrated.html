              <p>These refill dog poop bags, though amazing in their own right, are also incredible in being eco-friendly. They're made from 65% certified post-consumer plastic, giving new life to waste that would've been thrown into the ocean as pollution, or even landfill</p>

              <p>This is Earth Rated's Fly Toy. Every other current toy of Earth Rated is made from certified natural rubber, but for this specific toy it is made from thermoplastic elastomer, which though is plastic is significantly easier to recycle.</p>
